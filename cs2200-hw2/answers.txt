Question 1
----------

The JALR direction can be emulated with three other instructions in the ISA. 
The first step of JALR saves the PC address inside the $ra register. This 
can be  remade by using LEA with the desination register as $ra and the label 
as the number literal 0. This saves the PC to $at. The next step would be to use
BGE or BLE using $zero and SR1 and SR2 to instruct the program to do an unconditional
jump to the value at the destination register. LEA can be used before this to set 
the value of the destination register to the PC to be offset to.
